# Uniform Matrix Product States
This small package is designed to handle uniform _matrix product states_ (uMPS), i.e. matrix product states in the thermodynamic limit composed of a single, repeating unit cell.
Specifically, an implementation of the VUMPS algorithm [[1]] is provided, which can find uMPS approximations for the ground state of Hamiltonians, contract 2D partition functions, etc.

## Installation
Once you fetched a copy, you want to add the package to your MATLAB path.
The easiest way is running the command `addpath(genpath('<path>/umps'))` from your MATLAB terminal and you are good to go.
Alternatively one can run `addpath('<path>/umps/classes','<path>/umps/inc','<path>/umps/lib')`.
This adds the three necessary directories: `classes` contains all the class definitions, `inc` contains all the core  functions, and `lib` contains external resources.
The subpackages are `algorithms` (main optimization routines), `linalg` (linear algebra routines for tensors) and `util` (extra functions that can come in handy).
If you want to permanently add these directories to your matlabpath, use the command `savepath`.

A good place to get started and test that everything works in in the `examples` directory.
Here you will find use cases of VUMPS to find ground states of different types of operators, and to approximately contract
Additional information can be obtained with the command `help umps` or `help <command>`.

## Features
* Contractions optimized for large bond dimensions The complexity should never be more than _O(D<sup>3</sup>)_ for a fixed bond dimension _D_.
* Optimal increase of the bond dimension during the VUMPS iterations.
* Support for multi-site unit cells.

## Dependencies
The function `ncon.m` by R. N. C. Pfeifer [[2]] is used to perform tensor contractions.
A copy is provided in the `lib` folder.

## Notes
This has been tested up to MATLAB version R2017b.
Things might break in future versions, given Mathwork's history of releasing non-backwards-compatible updates.
